# Provider Package

This package is essentially the same as the `watcher` package, but was created as a separate implementation due to:

- Lack of proper documentation from the client
- Unclear requirements during initial development
- Need for a more maintainable and documented solution

The functionality remains similar, but this implementation aims to be more robust and better documented.

> Note: Future updates may merge these packages once requirements are fully clarified.
